***************Wave System**********************

1. Define the types of enemies in a wave

-Currently using a list of Enemy Pool Info for this

-Considerations
--What data is relevant to this system?
--How could you form a data structure to hold this data in a way that is easy to access/manipulate
--Will this data structure need any methods for accessing/modifying the data
--How will this data be used in the system/by other systems
--I think waves could be purely defined as a data structure that other systems use for spawning/scoring/etc

2. Define how many/how often each type will spawn in the wave

-Possible Methods (currently using Count)
--Count (pooling): Give each enemy type a specific number to spawn
--Percentage of total (pooling): Give a total number of enemies for the level, and give each enemy type a percentage of that total
--Spawn Rate (not pooling): Give each enemy type a spawn rate/timer and stop spawning once a given enemy total or duration is reached
--Percentage chance (not pooling): Have a universal spawn rate/timer and randomly choose the next enemy based off of spawn weights until a given enemy total/duration is reached
--Combination: Do some combination of above methods
--Multiple: Waves behave differently depending on the level

-Considerations
--Pooling will cause an upfront lag/increased load time but wont have to spawn enemies dynamically
--the actual pooling of enemies could be handled by a different script. but it affects what data needs to be stored by the wave info

****************Pooling System (if needed)*************

1. Use wave info to determine the pooling method, the enemy types, and their overall counts in the pool

2. Fill a queue with the enemies

-Considerations
--will the queue always be random?
---EX: Boss/Miniboss enemies could spawn every 10 enemies, not random
--

*****************Spawning System***********************

1. Spawn the enemies into lanes

-If pooling, uses the queue generated by the pooling system
-If non-pooling, uses a different heuristic to determing the next enemy to spawn

-Considerations
--Do all enemy types spawn in all lanes?
--Will lanes always have an equal weight for spawn chance?
--How often will the next enemy spawn?
---Random per enemy
---Random between enemies
---Set patterns
