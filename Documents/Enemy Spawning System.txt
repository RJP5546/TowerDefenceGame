Enemy Spawning System:

1. Define the types of enemies to spawn on a level

-Currently using a list of Enemy Pool Info for this

-Considerations

2. Define how many/how often each type will spawn

-Possible Methods (currently using Count)
--Count: Give each enemy type a specific number to spawn
--Percentage of total: Give a total number of enemies for the level, and give each enemy type a percentage of that total
--Spawn Rate: Give each enemy type a spawn rate/timer and stop spawning once a given enemy total or duration is reached
--Percentage chance: Have a universal spawn rate/timer and randomly choose the next enemy based off of spawn weights until a given enemy total/duration is reached
--Combination: Do some combination of above methods

-Considerations

3. Spawn the enemies into lanes

-Considerations
--Do all enemy types spawn in all lanes?
--Will lanes always have an equal weight for spawn chance?
